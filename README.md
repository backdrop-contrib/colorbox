COLORBOX
===================

This is a very simple module that opens up images or content from your Backdrop site into a popup/modal "lightbox" and is very customizable.

Colorbox is a light-weight, customizable lightbox plugin for jQuery 1.4.3+.  This module allows for integration of Colorbox into Backdrop.  Images, iframed or inline content etc. can be displayed in a overlay above the current page.

* JQuery - http://jquery.com/
